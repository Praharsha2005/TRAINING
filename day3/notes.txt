OPERATORS :- They are special type of symbols which is used to perform operations 

Interview ques
== checks only value not data type.
=== checks both values and data types. If any one of the value or data types is not equal then it returns false.

decision making statements :-

ASSIGNMENT:-


Write condition to check greatest among three numbers??
let a=20;
let b=30;
let c=40;






datatypes:-
1.primitive
2.non-primitive

operators:-
***********
- operators are special symbols whic used to perform operation on operands.
ex :-  2(operand1) + 2(operand2)

1.unary
2.binary
3.ternary (operand1 ? operand2 :operand3)

1.1 arithmatic 
1.2 assignment 
1.3 relational
1.4 logical 

1.1 arithmatic:- which performs operations such as,
        1.additional (concatenation :- joining of two or more string)
        2.substraction
        3.multiplication
        4.division
        5.modulus
        6.exponential
        7.increment(++)
                - pre-increment(++variable)
                - post-increment(variable++)
        8.decrement(--)

2.assignment operator:-
ex:- =
let a = 10;
additional assignment(+=)
substraction assignment(-=)
multiplication assignment(*=)
division assignment(/=)
mofulus assignment(%=)
exponential assignment(**=)

3.relational operator:-
- == , === , != , !== , > , >= , < , <=

- return type of relational operaots boolean values.

== - only checks value not a datatypes
=== - checks both data type and values.
!= - 

4.logical operators
&& , || , !
&& - both LHS & RHS true 
|| - anyone should be true
! - if true , it wil make false and vice-verse.

decision making statements:-
****************************
if 
if-else
else-if ladder
switch 
ternary condition

if:- 
- when only ione condition is there then we can use if.
- if block will work only for true statement.
if()
{
    
}

if-else:-
- if is a true statement
- else is a flase statment

looping statments:-
- iterating the block of code multiple times.
- for loop
    synatx: -  for(intitialization ; condition ; updation)
                    {//statements}
- while loop
syntax:- while(condition){//statment}
- do-while loop
-sytax :- do{//statments}
            while(condition)

which loops are entry controlled loops and exit controled loops?
entry controlled loops - for loop , while loop
exit controled loop - do-while loop
