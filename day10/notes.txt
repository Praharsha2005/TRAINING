create array of objects
*************************



what is object?
- Object is an entity which contains states and behaviors.
-states - properties , behaviour - functionality.
- Object is an entity to store the values in the form key and value pair.

synatax :-   let obj = {};
ex :-   let userdetails ={
        name:"Sam",
        age:23
        }

Note: - Javascript is mainly object -based language till 2015 (es6) 
- after es6 feature they added oops concept.

JSON :- 
*******
- JSON stands for Javascript object notation.
- JSON is a javscript technique used to transfer the data from client to server and server to client.

syntax :-  

js object :-
************
let a = {
        name :"value",
        age:25
}

json object:-
*************
{
        "name" :"Sam",
        "age" :25
}

- to create json file we have to create  a file with extension called
        "filename.json".

json methods:-
**************
1.JSON.stringify() :-it is used to convert JS obejct into json object.
2.JSON.parse() :- it is used to convert json object into javascript object.

Asynchronous in javascript:-
****************************
- to perform multiple task at a time.

1.setTimeout() :- it is web api used to perform asyn operations with certain timeouts.
syntax :-   setTimeout(callbackfn , timeout);

2.setInterval() :- it is a web api used to perform async operation at every time interval specified.
synatx :-  setInterval(callbackfn , timeout);

3.promise :- Promise is an object which represents eventual completion or failures of async operations.
        states of promise:-
        1.pending state
        2.fulfilled state
        3.rejected state

syntax :-    let x = new Promise((resolve , reject)=>{});

        to execute the promise we have instance methods:-
                1.then() :- it is used to execute success or fulfilled state results.
                2.catch() :- it is used to execute rejected state results.
                3.finally() :- once promise is settled it will print for both success/failures

4.async & await

note:- javscript is by default "Synchronous(single threaded)".
