create array of objects
*************************



what is object?
- Object is an entity which contains states and behaviors.
-states - properties , behaviour - functionality.
- Object is an entity to store the values in the form key and value pair.

synatax :-   let obj = {};
ex :-   let userdetails ={
        name:"Sam",
        age:23
        }

Note: - Javascript is mainly object -based language till 2015 (es6) 
- after es6 feature they added oops concept.

JSON :- 
*******
- JSON stands for Javascript object notation.
- JSON is a javscript technique used to transfer the data from client to server and server to client.

syntax :-  

js object :-
************
let a = {
        name :"value",
        age:25
}

json object:-
*************
{
        "name" :"Sam",
        "age" :25
}

- to create json file we have to create  a file with extension called
        "filename.json".

json methods:-
**************
1.JSON.stringify() :-it is used to convert JS obejct into json object.
2.JSON.parse() :- it is used to convert json object into javascript object.

Asynchronous in javascript:-
****************************
- to perform multiple task at a time.

1.setTimeout() :- it is web api used to perform asyn operations with certain timeouts.
syntax :-   setTimeout(callbackfn , timeout);

2.setInterval() :- it is a web api used to perform async operation at every time interval specified.
synatx :-  setInterval(callbackfn , timeout);

3.promise :- Promise is an object which represents eventual completion or failures of async operations.
        states of promise:-
        1.pending state
        2.fulfilled state
        3.rejected state

4.async & await

note:- javscript is by default "Synchronous(single threaded)".











NOTE;
What is the default font size of the tags(h1… h6 , paragraph,... title headers and others.
Dynamically adding the images to the HTML from JS.
JSON
It is abbreviated as javascript object notation.
It’s a javascript tech used to transfer the data from clinett o the server
Json object:
Syntax:
{
“Name”:”manohar”
}
The key must be double quotes always and can be given inside the curly braces { //content }
This is an external file to be created and can’t be directly performed inside the other files.
Format: filename.json
JSON.stringify() → it is used to convert JS objects into json objects.
JSON.parse() → Parsing is used to convert a json object into a javascript object.

Synchronous | Asynchronous in JS
synchronous states that acting on a single task at once. And go to the next task only when task one is completed. Whereas the Asynchronous states perform multiple tasks at a time.
Multiple threading; single threading are two methods:
Single threading is achieved performing one task at a time. Javascript is single threaded by default. While the mutiple threading makes more tasks to be performed at once. JS allows multiple threading using Async.
Asynchronous:
Some keys that are defaulty available in the JS are:
setTimeout() → It’s a web API performing Async operations with certain time out:
Syntax: setTimeout(callbackfn, timeout);
console.log(19); // its sets 
console.log(33);
setTimeout(()=>{
    console.log(100);
},1000)
console.log(31);
console.log(52);

setInterval() → is making the action to perform recursively for a set of time.
Promise
It is an object represents eventual completion or failures
States of promise:
Pending state


Async & and await
